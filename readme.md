There is no open source dataset on road works sign board (Men at work, work in progess indicating), I collected around 600 images from the internet sources and annotated them in yolo format. Later I used augmentation techniques on the images to increase the size of the dataset to 1032 images and annotated those augmented images in the required yolo format.  

Final Dataset : Train set = 930 and Valid set = 102

Yolov5 model is used to train our custom object detection model for road works sign board detection.
